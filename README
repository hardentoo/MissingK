Keera's MissingK
===========================================

We all find some functions missing in Haskell that appear in our programs over
and over. This module contains such functions.

If you find something here that is already in some other package, please let me
know.  I'll probably prefer to depend on that instead and make this as small as
possible.

MissingK depends on glib, which needs gtk2hs-buildtools installed (and in your
PATH, which will probably be $HOME/.cabal/bin if you installed
gtk2hs-buildtools with cabal). It also needs the library glib2.0, which in
Ubuntu you can install with:

    $ apt-get install libglib2.0-dev

Because gtk2hs-buildtools depends on happy and alex, you may want to install
those too, either with cabal or with apt-get. The syntax is analogous.

    $ apt-get install alex happy


Reverse dependencies
===========================================

Keera Hails depends on this package a lot, mainly because there were functions
that I needed all over the place. Some functions may disappear if I find them
somewhere else, but this package has been quite stable over the years. So feel
free to use it/depend on it.

Notes
===========================================

I do not like depending on glib from here. It's a huge dependency. It's use for
exception handling.  It's not going to change in the near future, but just be
warned that that might disappear. If you have ideas on this, send me a message.
